# Ratoru Homepage

This is my personal website's 4th iteration. You can find my blog and my past work [there](https://ratoru.com).

It also includes an RSS feed. For more information about RSS feeds in general, see [aboutfeeds.com](https://aboutfeeds.com/).

## ðŸ”¨ Tools

My homepage was built using [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), Markdoc, and Tailwind CSS.

The blog is based on [Astro-Paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
