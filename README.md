# Ratoru Homepage

This is my personal website's 3rd iteration. You can find my blog and my past work there.

It also includes an RSS feed. For more information about RSS feeds in general, see [aboutfeeds.com](https://aboutfeeds.com/).

## 🔨 Tools

My homepage was built using [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), Markdoc, and Tailwind CSS.

The blog is heavily inspired by [Blogster](https://github.com/flexdinesh/blogster).

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
